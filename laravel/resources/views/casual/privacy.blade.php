<p class="center">Privacy Policy</p>

<p>This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for Feeduciary.com. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website.</p>

<p class="center">Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</p>

<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>

<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>

<p class="center">Information You Provide to Us</p>

<p>The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><b>Basic Account Information:</b> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Feeduciary.com account to provide a username and email address.</p>

<p><b>Public Profile Information:</b> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. Your public profile is just that–public–so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</p>

<p><b>Transaction and Billing Information:</b> If you buy something from us–a subscription to a Feeduciary.com plan–you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</p>

<p class="center">Information We Collect Automatically</p>

<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>

<p><b>Log Information:</b> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your profile on Feeduciary.com.</p>

<p><b>Usage Information:</b> We collect information about your usage of our Services. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at Feeduciary.com, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</p>

<p><b>Location Information:</b> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.</p>

<p><b>Stored Information:</b> We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile app. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.</p>

<p><b>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies:</b> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails. Automatic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand e-mail campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.</p>

<p class="center">Information We Collect from Other Sources</p>

<p><b>We may also get information about you from other sources. Some information on Feeduciary.com includes data collected from publicly available sources, including company profiles and the information filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. If any information on Feeduciary.com is inaccurate, please contact us at info@feeduciary.com to make necessary corrections. Some profiles on Feeduciary.com were aggregated through publicly available sources. Profiles can be claimed by the advisor named in the profile or removed upon request. Please contact us at info@feeduciary.com.</b></p>

<p>We may also get information from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users, which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes.</p>

<p class="center">How We Use Information</p>

<p>We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> To provide our Services and to further develop our Services</li>
<li> To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
<li> To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of others;</li>
<li> To communicate with you about offers and promotions we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on and our products; and</li>
<li> To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations and serve relevant advertisements.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center">Information Shared Publicly</p>

<p>Information that you choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>

<p class="center">Security</p>

<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.</p>

<p class="center">Registration</p>

<p>In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. At your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself, but it is not required.</p>

<p class="center">Links</p>

<p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy  statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information. </p>
